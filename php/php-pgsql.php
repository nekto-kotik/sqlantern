	https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/short-guides/quoting-rules
	
	> Double quotes are used to indicate identifiers within the database, which are objects like tables, column names, and roles. In contrast, single quotes are used to indicate string literals.
	
	https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-lexical.html
	
	> There is a second kind of identifier: the delimited identifier or quoted identifier. It is formed by enclosing an arbitrary sequence of characters in double-quotes ("). A delimited identifier is always an identifier, never a key word. So "select" could be used to refer to a column or table named “select”, whereas an unquoted select would be taken as a key word and would therefore provoke a parse error when used where a table or column name is expected.
	
	> Quoting an identifier also makes it case-sensitive, whereas unquoted names are always folded to lower case. For example, the identifiers FOO, foo, and "foo" are considered the same by PostgreSQL, but "Foo" and "FOO" are different from these three and each other. (The folding of unquoted names to lower case in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL standard, which says that unquoted names should be folded to upper case. Thus, foo should be equivalent to "FOO" not "foo" according to the standard. If you want to write portable applications you are advised to always quote a particular name or never quote it.)

	MariaDB/MySQL have "Key" in response to "DESCRIBE {table}"/"SHOW COLUMNS FROM {table}", and the possible values are:
	PRI, UNI, MUL (and of course empty value)
	and I don't fully agree with their logic... so I'm not sure if I should even keep them as is in the MariaDB/MySQL driver, and I definitely shouldn't add them as such here.
	https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-columns.html
	
	Maybe I'll start following pgAdmin here and set `PK` and whatever else it uses...
	
	For now, I want "Field", "Type", "Key" in structure, the same way MariaDB/MySQL driver lists it.
	And in indexes: "Index", "Columns", "Unique", and "Cardinality" if it is a thing.
	Maybe add something PostgreSQL-specific?
	
	<del>"Key" should be PRI, UNI, KEY</del>
	If PRI, it's always unique, but not vice versa.
	
	Indexes-related documentation:
	https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-index.html
	https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-class.html
	
	By the way, BOOL columns work even _WITHOUT_ checking `IS TRUE`.
	
	Looking at `usda.nut_data`...
	psql lists index columns separated by a comma and uses PRIMARY KEY:
	Indexes:
		"nut_data_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (ndb_no, nutr_no)
		"nut_data_deriv_cd_idx" btree (deriv_cd)
		"nut_data_nutr_no_idx" btree (nutr_no)
		"nut_data_src_cd_idx" btree (src_cd)
	Foreign-key constraints:
		"nut_data_deriv_cd_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (deriv_cd) REFERENCES deriv_cd(deriv_cd)
		"nut_data_ndb_no_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (ndb_no) REFERENCES food_des(ndb_no)
		"nut_data_nutr_no_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (nutr_no) REFERENCES nutr_def(nutr_no)
		"nut_data_src_cd_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (src_cd) REFERENCES src_cd(src_cd)
	Referenced by:
		TABLE "datsrcln" CONSTRAINT "datsrcln_ndb_no_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (ndb_no, nutr_no) REFERENCES nut_data(ndb_no, nutr_no)
	
	pgAdmin has a visual toggle `Primary Key?`, which is enabled for 2 columns: `ndb_no` and `nutr_no`.
	I want to note the question mark in `Primary Key?`, it's an interesting touch.
	It doesn't list `nut_data_pkey` in "indexes" list, confusingly (well, to me).
	What about `usda.datsrcln`?
	Same, there is a triple primary key, which is not listed in "indexes"... so, psql and pgAdmin don't agree what to list among indexes, that's amazing... :-(
	Oh, found it!
	The "Constraints" tab in the table properties popup has sub-tabs: "Primary key", "Foreign key", etc.
	I can finally see, at last: columns of indexes are comma-separated and even without a space between them (same with Primary Key and Foreign Key):
	`ndb_no,nutr_no,datasrc_id`
	At that when even the built-in `indexdef` displays them with a space, what's wrong with you, pgAdmin? :-(
	
	Adminer + `usda.nut_data`:
	Indexes
	PRIMARY	ndb_no, nutr_no
	INDEX	deriv_cd
	INDEX	nutr_no
	INDEX	src_cd
	...comma-separated, with a space
	...foreign keys look bad, IMHO - I don't get them :-(
	
	Adminer + `usda.datsrcln`:
	Indexes
	PRIMARY	ndb_no, nutr_no, datasrc_id
	INDEX	datasrc_id
	...comma-separated, with a space
	
	So, psql and Adminer agree in full, while pgAdmin took a different route: Primary Key not listed among indexes, and no space between columns.
	
	I see 3 type of indexes in Adminer:
	PRIMARY, UNIQUE, INDEX
	With "INDEX" being kind of excessive, I don't agree with it.
	I'm leaning towards: PRIMARY, UNIQUE, [empty]
	And that's for marking them in structure actually, maybe with MULTI, like MariaDB/MySQL do, but that's not really informative. Because a column can be a separate index and a member of multi-key index at the same time, can't tell that from the structure side.
	
	All right, I finally have a decision.
	I don't like that MUL means any key in MySQL, single- or multi-column.
	A single-column index gets MUL, and a one of multi-column index gets MUL, as well.
	It's strange.
	I think I want PRI, UNI (if not PRI), KEY and MUL
	And if a column is both a single-column key and a part of multi-column key, it should get MUL.
	It's all in the structure, not in indexes.
	Indexes only get Unique and Primary (and MySQL's SHOW INDEXES doesn't have a Primary column, what the heck...)

CONCERNING `SHOW CREATE TABLE`

I realize I'm a bit late to this party, but this was the first result to my Google Search so I figured I'd answer with what I came up with.

You can get pretty far toward a solution with this query to get the columns:
```
SELECT *
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'YOURSCHEMA' AND table_name = 'YOURTABLE'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

And then this query for most common indexes:

```
SELECT c.oid, c.relname, a.attname, a.attnum, i.indisprimary, i.indisunique
FROM pg_index AS i, pg_class AS c, pg_attribute AS a
WHERE i.indexrelid = c.oid AND i.indexrelid = a.attrelid AND i.indrelid = 'YOURSCHEMA.YOURTABLE'::regclass
ORDER BY" => "c.oid, a.attnum
```

Then it is a matter of building out the query string(s) in the right format.
